# Sliding Window Maximum Visualization Scaffold

This crate prepares a Bevy scene with an input array, a highlighted window, and a deque panel that will show candidate indices for the maximum.

## Running

```sh
cargo run
```

You'll see array bars along the bottom, a translucent sliding window overlay, and a side panel representing the deque's front/back. Hook up pointer logic and movement animations to complete the visualization.
