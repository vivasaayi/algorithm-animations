# Copy List With Random Pointer Visualization Scaffold

This crate prepares a Bevy scene for the linked list duplication problem where each node has both `next` and `random` pointers. It renders the original list, highlights random edges, and lays out space for the cloned list so you can animate the interweaving and separation steps.

## Running

```sh
cargo run
```

When you launch the scene youâ€™ll see the source list with random pointer ribbons, placeholders for the interwoven clone nodes, and the final detached copy lane. Hook in the copy algorithm to walk `current`, build `clone`, and restore `random` connections step by step.
