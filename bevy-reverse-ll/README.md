# Reverse Linked List Visualization Scaffold

This crate bootstraps a Bevy scene that highlights the pointer choreography for reversing a singly linked list. It draws the nodes, arrow connectors, `prev` / `curr` / `next` markers, and a panel describing the upcoming steps.

## Running

```sh
cargo run
```

When started, you'll see the original list laid out horizontally along with pointer labels and a scratch space for the reversed list. Animate the pointer updates, node detachment, and list reconstruction to complete the walkthrough.
