# Move Zeros Visualization Scaffold

This crate renders an input array, a compacted array view, and placeholder arrows for the slow/fast pointers used in a stable move-zeros algorithm.

## Running

```sh
cargo run
```

The scene shows two rows of bars (original and compacted) plus pointer labels. Animation logic still needs to be implemented.
