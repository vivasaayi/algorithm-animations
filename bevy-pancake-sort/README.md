# Pancake Sort Visualization Scaffold

This crate opens a Bevy window with placeholder sprites representing a stack of pancakes along with flip markers to show where you would perform prefix reversals.

## Running

```sh
cargo run
```

You'll see a vertical stack of discs with varying radii, plus horizontal lines indicating potential flip positions. No animation yetâ€”this is just the starting point for wiring up pancake flips.
