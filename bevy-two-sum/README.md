# Two Sum Visualization Scaffold

This crate boots a Bevy scene with placeholders for an input array, a hash map area, and highlight overlays that would show the two-sum matching process.

## Running

```sh
cargo run
```

You should see the array laid out along the bottom, a floating panel representing the hash table, and translucent highlight bars for current indices. No interactivity yetâ€”this is the foundation for wiring up the algorithm animation.
