# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters Visualization Scaffold

This crate spins up a Bevy window with placeholder sprites for the character stream, sliding window, frequency table, and highlight markers used when tracking the current best substring.

## Running

```sh
cargo run
```

When launched, the scene shows a row of character tiles, a translucent window overlay, and a side panel that represents the set/map of characters currently in the window. Animation logic for expanding and shrinking the window still needs to be implemented.
