# Dutch National Flag Visualization Scaffold

This crate sets up a Bevy scene for the 3-way partitioning problem with placeholders for low, mid, and high buckets alongside the main array.

## Running

```sh
cargo run
```

You'll see an array of bars along the center, color-coded target buckets, and three pointer labels (low, mid, high) ready for animation. Actual sorting logic and pointer movement still need to be implemented.
