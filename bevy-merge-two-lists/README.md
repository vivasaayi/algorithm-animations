# Merge Two Sorted Lists Visualization Scaffold

This crate lays out a Bevy scene for the classic problem of merging two sorted linked lists. It draws two input lists, a cursor panel, and the emerging merged list so that pointer choreography can be animated.

## Running

```sh
cargo run
```

When you launch the scene, you'll see List A and List B stacked, with pointer markers showing the current nodes being compared and a result track where nodes are appended. Connect the step-by-step merge logic and pointer animations to bring the visualization to life.
