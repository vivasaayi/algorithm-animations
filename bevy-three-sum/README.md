# Three Sum Visualization Scaffold

This crate spins up a Bevy scene with placeholder sprites that illustrate sorting, sliding pointers, and the collection of discovered triplets for the classic "Three Sum" problem.

## Running

```sh
cargo run
```

On launch you will see a sorted array strip, pointers for the current indices, and a results panel for the found triplets. Hook in the pointer motion, duplicate skipping, and result logging to animate the full algorithm.
