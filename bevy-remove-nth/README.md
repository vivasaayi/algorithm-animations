# Remove Nth From End Visualization Scaffold

This crate sets up a Bevy scene for the linked list problem where you remove the N-th node from the end using a fast/slow pointer technique. It draws the original list, highlights the target gap between pointers, and shows the resulting list so you can attach animations that explain the algorithm.

## Running

```sh
cargo run
```

When you run it, you'll see the original list with slow and fast pointer labels, a gap banner indicating the N distance, and a result track prepared for the final list. Plug in the pointer advancement logic and removal animation to complete the visual story.
