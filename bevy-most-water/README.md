# Container With Most Water Visualization Scaffold

This crate sets up a Bevy scene with placeholder bars, pointer markers, and an area highlight for the classic "Container With Most Water" two-pointer problem. Use it as a starting point before wiring in pointer movement and maximum area updates.

## Running

```sh
cargo run
```

Upon launch, you will see a row of wall heights, translucent overlays for the current container, and text labels describing the selected pointers and area. Hook up the two-pointer logic and animations to bring it to life.
