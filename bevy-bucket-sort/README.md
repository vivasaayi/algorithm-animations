# Bucket Sort Visualization Scaffold

This crate opens a Bevy window with placeholder entities for the input array, bucket bins, and a staging area where sorted values would line up after collection.

## Running

```sh
cargo run
```

You'll see colored bars representing the unsorted array along the bottom, translucent rectangles for buckets in the middle, and a top row ready for the concatenated output. Animations and data flow still need to be wired in.
