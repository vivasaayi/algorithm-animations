# Sort a Linked List Visualization Scaffold

This crate sets up the Bevy scene for merge-sorting a singly linked list. It displays the unsorted list, a recursive split view, and the merged output lane so you can animate pointer movements, merges, and depth transitions.

## Running

```sh
cargo run
```

When you run the scene youâ€™ll see the original list across the top, two halves staged in the middle, and the merged result lane near the bottom. Use the empty placeholders and labels to hook in your merge animations and show how pointer comparisons drive the sort.
