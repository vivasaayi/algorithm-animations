# Bevy BST Insert/Delete

Visualization of binary search tree insertion and deletion operations.

Run with: `cargo run`

Scene: BST nodes with edges, operations log showing insert/delete steps, current path highlighted in yellow, inserted nodes in green, deleted in red.

The window opens with a simple placeholder sprite. Replace the logic in `src/main.rs` with the actual visualization systems when ready.
