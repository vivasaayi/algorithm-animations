# Bevy BST Insert/Delete

Scaffolding crate for visualizing insertion and deletion operations in a binary search tree using Bevy 0.14. Currently ships a placeholder scene so the project builds cleanly while the full animation is under construction.

## Development

```
cargo run
```

The window opens with a simple placeholder sprite. Replace the logic in `src/main.rs` with the actual visualization systems when ready.
