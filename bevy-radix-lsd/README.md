# Radix Sort (LSD) Visualization Scaffold

This crate prepares a Bevy window with placeholder entities for the input array and digit buckets used in a least-significant-digit radix sort pass.

## Running

```sh
cargo run
```

Launching the app shows colored bars for the array and a staged grid of buckets representing digits 0â€“9 across multiple passes. No animations are wired up yet.
