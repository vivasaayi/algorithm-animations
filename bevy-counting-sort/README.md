# Counting Sort Visualization Scaffold

This crate sets up a Bevy window and some placeholder entities that resemble counting sort bins and the input array.

## Running

```sh
cargo run
```

You should see colored bars along the bottom representing the array and a row of counting buckets above them. Nothing is animated yetâ€”this scaffold just gives you a starting point.
